## What is microsimulation modelling?

Microsimulation  modelling  is  a  methodology  that  uses  micro  units (e.g.,  firms, individuals, households) to run ex-ante simulation analysis of public policies andeconomic or social changes.  
Two main characteristics of microsimulation models:

1. They use surveys or administrative data.
2. They use computer languages (e.g., Python, R, Stata)

Microsimulation  modelling  has  existed  since  the  late  1950s  and  it  has its  formal roots  in  a  proposal  by  Orcutt  (1957,  1960). While its progress  was  relatively limited  until  the  1990s,  micro-based  simulation analysis  is  now  used  extensivelyaround the world for policy analysis and design.

## What is Beamm?

The BElgian Arithmetic Microsimulation Model (BEAMM) is a microsimulation model to simulate public policies in Belgium. Based  on  data  representative  of  the whole  population, the  BEAMM  aims  to  be an innovative  tool  for  policy analysis  and  evaluation to  study  the  effect  of tax-benefit reforms at the individual and household level.
  
The BEAMM is a one-country (Belgium) static tax-benefit microsimulation model.
  
“Tax-Benefit models are computer programs that represent the rules governing a country’s taxand benefit system; by applying these rules to a set of households that is representative of thepopulation, it is possible to evaluate the impact of existing tax-benefit systems [. . . ].” (Immervolland O’Donoghue, 2002)
  
“A  typical  single-country  tax-benefit  model  consists  of  coded  policy rules  programmed  in  ageneric language (e.g., FORTRAN or C++) or software package (e.g., Stata or R), interactingdirectly with the input data.” (Sutherland, 2014)
