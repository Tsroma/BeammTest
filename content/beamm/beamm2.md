## What?
The synthetic micro-dataset created in the previous step necessarily represents a moment in the past: the moment at which the data were collected. However, the Beamm tax-benefit micro-simulation model is most often used to evaluate policy reforms in the present or future. Hence, we need to bring the micro-data 'closer to the present or future'. 
# How
We use the Federal Planning Bureau's projections of   economic growth and the demographic evolution of the population to adapt the population weights in function of the demographic projections and we uprate the prices and wages in function of the economic projections. This process brings us a synthetic micro-dataset that reflects the present or future as well as possible.
