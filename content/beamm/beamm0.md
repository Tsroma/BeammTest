## What is Beamm?

Beamm stands for BElgian Arithmetic Microsimulation Model, and is a tax-benefit microsimulation model. A tax-benefit microsimulation model simulates the tax-benefit system on micro-data, i.e., it simulates the rules of the tax system and social security for each individual or household in a representative sample  of  the whole  population. This allows you to study how the impact of a policy reform varies with the socio-economic characteristics of all individual and households in the sample.
  
To build Beamm, and to allow you to analyze the impact of a policy reform, we proceeded in 5 steps: 
1. Creation of a synthetic micro-dataset    
2. Reweighting and uprating the synthetic micro-data  
3. Simulating the tax-benefit system  
4. Analysis and visualization  
5. Behavioral modelling. 

We summarize each step on this page. Click on the buttons for more information.
