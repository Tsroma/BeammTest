# What?
Once the Beamm microsimulation model has twice calculated for each individual or household all the covered taxes and benefits - once for the tax-benefit system before the chosen policy reform and after the reform - it can proceed with a detailed analysis and visualization of the reform's impact from a variety of viewpoints. 
# How?
By aggregating the changes in paid taxes, Beamm can precisely compute and decompose the budgetary impact of a reform. Likewise, Beamm can compute for each individual or household the change in disposable (i.e., net) income due to the reform. Because we have for all individuals a lot of information about  their socio-economic characteristics (age, household composition, education, work, housing characteristics, income, mobility, risk of poverty, disability etc.), Beamm can present a detailed picture of how the reform affects different groups of citizens differently, who wins or loses etc. Beamm can also compute many other policy impact dimensions, such as changes in labor costs for employers etc.  
# Combined reforms
Note that from an equity perspective, Beamm can not only depict a very detailed picture of how different socio-economic groups are impacted differently by a policy reform, or how vulnerable citizens are impacted. Beamm also allows policy makers, citizens and researchers to combine a targeted policy reform with detailed compensating policy measures to mitigate possible inequitable effects of a reform. Indeed, given that Beamm is a detailed model of (a big part of) the Belgian tax-benefit system and institutional context, Beamm users can combine a policy reform with detailed compensation measures at the right institutional level and compute the combined impact of such combination of measures in a single simulation.
