# How?
Beamm then applies all the rules of the Belgian tax-benefit system to each individual in the micro-dataset constructed in step 1. Hence, Beamm computes for each individual or household all the due taxes, the transfers that the individual is entitled to, the disposable income etc. This simulation of the tax-benefit system is performed twice: once for the current fiscal system prior to runtime, and once for a reform scenario, where a reform is chosen by you, the user, in the Beamm graphical user interface. 
# What?
Beamm covers at present the personal income tax (Fantasi), social security sontributions, VAT & excise duties, inheritance taxes, car taxes, property taxes, investment income taxes, gift taxes, birth allowances, income support, child benefits, pensions and maternity leave. 
Besides this standard set of policies, the researchers at CAPE can also use Beamm as a polyvalent platform for policy support and scientific research, by adding custom public policies.  
More details of how Beamm model handles these different taxes and transfers can be found in our documentation on the tax-benefit system.
