# Microsimulation
Microsimulation  modelling  is  a  methodology  that  uses  micro  units (e.g.,  firms, individuals, households) to run ex-ante simulation analysis of public policies and economic or social changes.  
Two main characteristics of microsimulation models:
1. They use surveys or administrative data.
2. They intensively use computers   
Microsimulation  modelling  has  existed  since  the  late  1950s  and  it  has its  formal roots  in  a  proposal  by  Orcutt  (1957,  1960). While its progress  was  relatively limited  until  the  1990s,  micro-based  simulation analysis  is  now  used  extensively around the world for policy analysis and design.

# Beamm
Beamm is a tax-benefit microsimulation platform developed and maintained by the Center for Applied Public Economics (CAPE) at the Universit√© Saint-Louis - Bruxelles since 2020. 
Beamm is almost entirely built in R, and makes intensive use of the R Tidyverse set of R packages for data science. The online interfaces are built with the R Shiny, R Blogdown, R Bookdown packages as well as the Hugo static site generator.
