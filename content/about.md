who_we_are:
  description: The Center for Applied Public Economics (CAPE) at the Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles was created at the end of 2018, and works on various research topics in public finance, with a particular attention for labor market policy, mobility, environmental issues and socio-economic inequalities. At the core of CAPE's research activities is the Beamm project, an effort to build a comprehensive online, open-access tax-benefit microsimulation model. Besides scientific research, CAPE also helps public administrations, policy makers and other interested parties with public policy evaluations, socio-economic impact analyses, spending reviews and other methodological support. CAPE chooses to work with all researchers in a closely knit team, with all team members closely working together on a highly collaborative research project.
